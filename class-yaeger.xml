            <p>An elven man flashes a grin as several fiends descend upon him. In a quick flurry, the elf harnesses his focus and unleashes a series of powerful blows, bringing down teh fiends to crumple onto the groudn before him.</p>
            <p class="indent">A human woman stands on the edge of a cliff overlooking a vast forest. Taking a deep breath, she focuses on teh sounds and scents carried by the wind. After a minute, she opens her eyes and gracefully jumps off of the cliff's edge, pursuing her quarry.</p>
            <p class="indent">A dwarf nimbly evades teh swing of a monster's mighty claws. Upon landing to the side, the dwarf quickly pivots and immediately leaps toward the terrifying beast. HIs glaive at teh ready, the dwarf focuses all of his energy into his swing, delivering a fatal blow as the beast unleashes its final cry.</p>
            <p class="indent">Hunters and slayers of foul monsters, the mighty yaegers are warriors who studdy the occult and obtain enhanced abilities, senses, and speed with which to better combat the supernatural.</p>
            <h4>Monster Hunters</h4>
            <p>Yaegers are monster hunters, training to refine their bodies, minds, and senses to better fight against foul beasts. They study occultism and the supernatural, and learn the ways of combat to fight against such threats. In addition to their rigorous martial and endurance training, yaegers learn to master their focus and mental composure. Through the use of such focus, they can exercise better control of their resolve and attacks to deliver deadlier blows. When yaegers are on a hunt, they focus almost exclusively on the task at hand.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once they reach a certain point, a yaeger joins a yaeger guild; a group of yaegers who utilize different abilities to supplement their martial prowess and apporach monster hunting in unique ways. When a yaegar joins a yaegar guild, it involves some type of supernaturally infused induction ceremony; a mystical riutal, a foul concoction, or a special rite. This grants a yaeger supernatural abilities that make them more capable of fighting terribel and otherwordly threats, and often alters their appearance or personality.</p>
            <h4>Supernatural Slayers</h4>
            <p>By definition, the life of a yaeger is one of adventuring. Until their dying breath, a yaeger dedicates their life to hunting foul creatures and terrifying beasts. From undead and werewolves to aberrations and fiends, yaegers journey to the darkest of realms and the most haunting of places to fight against the vile creatures that threaten the mortal realms.</p>
            <p class="indent">At their core, yaegers are professional students of the occult and slayers of monsters. This makes them incredibly useful members of an adventuring party, as their skills make them dangerous foes both on and off the battlefield. Since monsters never rest, neither do yaegers, and their work is never done.</p>
            <h5>Yaegers in Yvarra</h5>
            <p>In Yvarra, yaegers are the premier and most efficient monster hunters in the world. However, yaegers as they are known in modern Yvarra were not always the monster hunters that they became to be. The origins of yaegers can be traced back thousands of years ago to the now ruined and accursed land of Satama. There, the ancient vyrassa used blood magic to create a group of highly trained 'super hunters' known as reavers. These reavers became an elite order that directly served the Sataman nobility and judicial systems, tracking down criminals and silencing political foes.</p>
            <p class="indent">When Satama fell alongside Athar and Xelegos during the Age of Calamity, many of the ancient texts and rites surrounding reavers were lost. However, shortly before the rise of the Witch Queens and the Age of Witchcraft, explorers uncovered lost texts detailing the rituals that created reavers. Using what they could translate and uncover, certain groups set about trying to create a new age of reavers in order to combat against the growing threat of monsters and otherworldly entities that began to flood ancient Yvarra. During this time, these new reavers fought against these supernatural forces, and it was not long before academics and arcane scholars began to experiment with the Sataman rituals. Many of these experiments were failures, but the ones that succeeded allowed for the creation of new elite super-hunters to fight monsters. Thus, the yaegers of Yvarra as they are known as now were born.</p>
            <h5>Yaeger Origins</h5>
            <p><strong>Nations.</strong>Yvarran yaegers can be members of any race, and their guilds can exist in many lands across Yvarra. Some of the most famous yaeger guilds, such as the hexers and pyromants, operate in the Icilian Empire, Kravnia, the Northern Realms, and Soldan.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Races.</strong>Yvarran yaegers can be members of any race, though they are most often capran, dwarves, elves, graam, grepkin, humans, isf√∂dda, ursa, and vyrassa.</p>
            <h5>Roles of the Yaeger</h5>
            <p>Yaegers are monster hunters through and through. Very rarely does their role in society at large stray too far from this, though some employ yaegers for various tasks that are best suited for their skills and fighting and tracking.</p>
            <p class="indent">Though many yaegers specialize in fighting particular types of supernatural entities and beings, a yaeger can wield their ritualistically imbued gifts to combat against any form of extraplanar or otherworldly threat. However, some yaegers often end up fighting mortals as well, frequently becoming involved in political affairs, warfare, criminal activity, and the squabbles of nobles. Regardless of their nature of their work, yaegers primarily pursue supernatural threats and dispose of dangerous magical creatures, often charging for their services or expecting favors for their guilds in return.</p>
            <p class="indent">The following roles are optional, flavor-driven choices a player can make that can influence what kind of hunter and tracker an Yvarran yaeger can be. You can choose to roll randomly on the table below, choose an option, or work with your GM to create a role.</p>

             <h4>Elements of Yaeger Characters</h4>
            <p>The life of a yaeger is one filled with violence, long periods of travel, and harsh conditions. Because of this, think about why your character decided to become a yaeger in the first place. Was it something that was expected of them, or was triggered by a dark event?</p>
            <p class="indent">Second, yaegers train with others under the tutelage and instruction of a seasoned yaeger, known as a master. What was your instructor like? Were they careful to teach you all that you need to know, or were they distant and tough on you to learn things by experience?</p>
            <p class="indent">When making your yaeger character more unique, consider utilizing the following sections and their associated tables: Inception, Master, and Memento.</p>
            <h5>Inception</h5>
            <p>Not everyone is cut out to be a yaeger; a yaeger's life is filled with turmoil and uncertainty that can drive those who lack dedication and resolve quite mad.</p>
            <p class="indent">When creating a yaeger, consider what did lead them to take up this life. What was it that motivated them?</p>
            <table class="inception">
			    <thead>
			        <tr><td class="col-5">d6</td><td class="left">Inception</td></tr>

		    </table>
            <h5>Master</h5>
            <p>Yaegers who live to become masters are those with enough experience, wisdom, and resolve to have avoided death at the hands of the supernatural. These masters have grown old in a profession where many die young, sharing their knowledge with new yaegers.</p>
            <p class="indent">Think about the kind of master you trained under. Who were they? What was your relationship to them?</p>
            <table class="master">
			    <thead>
		            <tr><td class="col-5">d6</td><td class="left">Master</td></tr>

	        </table>
            <h5>Memento</h5>
            <p>Yaegers carry with them something that represents their story, earned in training or something they pried off of the corpse of a monster they killed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider what kind of memento your yaeger carries. What is it, and how did you acquire it?</p>
            <table class="memento">
			    <thead>

            <h4>Creating a Yaeger</h4>
            <p>When creating a yaeger, think about what drove your character to take up this life. Did a tragic event occur in their past, or were their lives changed by a monster?</p>
            <p class="indent">Next, think about how your yaeger perceives and views the occult and supernatural. Do they view all monsters as just that - monsters?</p>
            <p class="indent">Do they believe many creatures labeled as monsters to be misunderstood, having their own personalities and problems that mortals might not understand or even be aware of?</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, consider your character's personal history with the supernatural prior to the start of the campaign. What occult or supernatural entities have they encountered, and in what way? Were they ignorant to many elements of the supernatural prior to becoming a yaeger? Or have they experienced the paranormal first hand, either willingly or by way of some gruesome and horrifying event that left them scarred?</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, discuss with your GM how yaegers are perceived by most people, as well as how common yaegers are in your setting. Are yaegers heralded as saviors? Or are yaegers seen as monsters themselves? Are there famous and established guilds of yaegers, or are yaegers created in secrecy and are no longer as common throughout the world as they once were? Are there any yaeger guilds that are famed for their exploits, having fought off threat after threat? Or are many yaeger guilds dangerous organizations, universally feared for their ritualistic practices and supernatural powers?</p>
            <p class="indent">Talk to your GM about the role played by yaegers in the campaign.</p>
            <h5>Quick Build</h5>
            <p>You can make a yaeger quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution or Wisdom. Second, choose a background found in Chapter 4 of this book.</p>

			<p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the witch spells you know with another spell of your choice from the witch spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or enchantment spell, unless you‚Äôre replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells, since you are wise to occult magic. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdiom modifier</p>

        <description>
            <p>The guild of yaegers known as the Guild of the Pyromant is the most famous yaeger guild in Yvarra. These yaegers master wielding both blade and flame, unleashing a fury of fire and steel. Induction into this guild often requires rites of fire and burning, such as pyres, hot coals, or branding.</p>
            <p class="indent">Known as pyromants, these yaegers come from many areas of Yvarra. In the Icilian Empire, these yaegers believe that their fire is divine and a gift from Avessia. In the northern lands of Ulvrand and Vanhamaa, these yaegers bring flame to combat the titans of frost. Some even come from Lonespire, where spireborn call upon glorious dragon fire. Elsewhere, pyromants may claim to wield the fires from the god Hothian, flames of destruction from the god Dayoth, cleansing fires from the Great Beasts, or fires of chaos from the god Quaine.</p>
            <p class="indent">However they view their fire, all pyromants know that the flames within them must not fade, and that they must keep their will burning to rise from the ashes.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Remnants are yaegers who belong to an ancient guild built upon the arts of necromancy and spiritualism. These yaegers acquire abilities that transform their bodies to adopt the strengths and resiliences of the undead, but at a high cost. Many of these yaegers lose parts of their mortality, personalities, and even some memories of their pasts fade away; effectively becoming a remnant of their former selves.</p>
            <p class="indent">Those who join this guild often undergo dangerous rites that bring them closer to death, such as ritualistic near death experiences or exposure to obscure necromancy. Many begin to resemble corpses, such as having cold, stiffer skin, dull colored eyes, and veins that appear blackened under the skin.</p>
            <p class="indent">Remnants in Yvarra originate in far eastern Kravnia, where they battled hostile spirits and undead creatures who pose great threat to the people. While among the most mysterious and esoteric of yaegers, some remnants are said to be members of religious sects who revere the Rotting God, serving as undead protectors and chosen warriors of powerful necromantic energies. Those few practitioners of necromancy in Yvarra often employ remnants to serve and protect them.</p>

        <supports>Yaeger Guild</supports>
        <description>
            <p>The guild of yaegers known as the Guild of the Wolf consists of warriors who not only recognize the strength and cunning of wolves but also seek to emulate such skill and prowess. Induction into this guild generally involves partaking in the blood of wolves, often via strange alchemical mixtures or consuming it, or rituals where inductees wear wolf pelts and dance under full moons or must wear it while partaking in hallucinogenic drugs and concoctions.</p>
            <p class="indent">Known as wolves, these yaegers are some of the strangest of yaegers in all of Yvarra. Some hail from guilds that revere Great Beasts who assume wolf-like forms, such as Freyune or Ylashra'han. Others simply follow ancient ritualistic practices and sacrificial ceremonies that involve wolves, and some are even members of guilds that have ties to lycanthropy. Fewer still are the yaegers that are mad enough to worship the Mad Hound, Dayoth the God of Madness and Curses. These yaegers often adorn their armor, clothing, jewelry, and weapons with imagery of wolves and moons and fur trimming.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, the rites and rituals used to induct yaegers into this guild often leave the newly initiated with physical alterations, such as sharpened fangs, thicker hair or fur, sharper nails, and a more lithe yet strong frame. Many also possess yellow or dark brown eyes, and have a tendency to sniff the air or the ground when they are tracking a creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whatever their reason for seeking to acquire the strength of wolves themselves, yaegers who belong to this guild are incredible hunters, preferring to fight alongside their comrades to take down their prey.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Often used when sealing or making bargains with a witch or crone, this spell allows you to inscribe a personal mark onto an object or creature. The mark can be a symbol, a word, or a brand, and cannot be larger than 3 inches in diameter.</p>
            <p class="indent">Inscribing the mark does not harm or affect the object or creature that it is inscribed upon, and can take on an appearance of your choosing (such as the mark appearing as if engraved into wood, left as a scar from a brand, stitched into fabric, burned into the surface, or etched as a tattoo).</p>
            <p class="indent">A target can only be marked by this spell once by you. If you attempt to inscribe an additional mark on the same target, the first mark immediately fades.</p>
            <p class="indent">The mark lasts indefinitely unless dispelled or dismissed as an action by the caster. The caster perfectly remembers upon what objects and creatures they have inscribed their mark.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you speak in Witchtongue when you cast this spell, you can cause the mark to appear invisible unless when a trigger condition is met. The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could cause the mark to become visible when a creature says a particular phrase, uses a particular object or the object is used in some way, or during a specific time each day.</p>

        <supports>Bard, Druid, Warlock, Witch, Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>A large murder of crows appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the murder consists of up to five 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 4d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, as the crows unleash a wave of dreadful cawing. The crows then vanish. A creature who is deafened is immune to this spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you speak in Witchtongue when you cast this spell, the cawing of the crows is mingled with speech, with some of the crows mimicking the voices of those nearby. A creature who fails its Dexterity saving throw takes additional psychic damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you create one additional cube for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

        <supports>Warlock, Witch</supports>
        <description>
            <p>Uttering a foul incantation, you attempt to curse a creature that you can see within range. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for 1 minute. While the target is cursed, multiple shards of arcane energy begin to float around the creature. These shards appear like sharp objects that can take on a form of your choice, but can be no longer than 3 feet each. For example, the shards can take the form of large nails, stakes, short spears, arrows, or needles.</p>
            <p class="indent">For the duration of the curse, whenever the creature takes the Attack, Cast a Spell, or Use an Object action, the creature takes 1d10 force damage. The creature can repeat their saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">A remove curse spell ends this curse early.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you speak in Witchtongue when you cast this spell, whenever the creature takes the Attack, Cast a Spell, or Use an Object action, the creature‚Äôs speed is reduced by 5 feet for the remainder of their turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, you deal an additional 1d10 force damage for each slot level above 1st.</p>

            <p>You draw wisps of solar power to you as you attempt to curse a creature with fear of the sun. Choose a creature that you can see within range to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is considered cursed and suffers the following penalties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>While in sunlight, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
                <li>The creature must also use its movement on its turn to move away from any source of sunlight that it can see. If there is no source of sunlight, the creature instead uses its movement to avoid any source of bright light that it can see, or otherwise takes the Hide action.</li>
                <li>When a creature moves into or within an area of sunlight, it takes 2d6 radiant damage for every 5 feet it travels.</li>

            <p class="indent">The ghostly form provides you with a shield of radiant lunar energy and blesses you with the calm tranquility of the night, granting you resistance to radiant damage and advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>

            <p>You momentarily conjure a horrifying spirit that lunges toward a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage and moves 10 feet away from you if it can move and its speed is at least 10 feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction is blocked, the target doesn't move. The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you speak in Witchtongue when you cast this spell, if the target fails its saving throw, the spirit assumes the form of one of its deepest fears.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

            <p>Your speech brings forth wonders of witchery and create one of the following effects within range:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You instantly make a flower or small plant begin to bloom or wither. Alternatively, you can cause the flower or small plant to change color or temporarily assume the form of another flower or small plant. This change lasts for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>You cause a creature of your choice within range to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature beings to experience harmless effects and symptoms of a bodily and physical disease or medical condition, such as a pox, rot, hives, bleeding, nausea, coughing, sneezing, or swelling. These effects last for up to 4 hours, at which point they fade.</li>
                <li>You can create illusory images that appear on a flat and reflective surface (such as a pool of water, a mirror, or a polished table). A willing creature that looks in the reflective surface sees either images of your choice or sees images that reflect their surface orinner thoughts. Such thoughts might be of a loved one or a fear the creature has regarding the future, or something they have done in the past. These images last for 1 minute or until you dismiss them.</li>
                <li>You cause a minor supernatural sensation at a point within range. Such an effect can be an illusory image of a specter, a cold snap and shivering goosebumps, the moan of a dying creature, ominous whispers or discordant melodies, or the color of nearby candles to flicker in shifting colors.</li>
                <li>You cause nearby non-secured objects to temporarily hover in the air before harmlessly floating back to the ground.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute or longer effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>
