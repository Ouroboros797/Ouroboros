            <p>An elven man flashes a grin as several fiends descend upon him. In a quick flurry, the elf harnesses his focus and unleashes a series of powerful blows, bringing down teh fiends to crumple onto the groudn before him.</p>
            <p class="indent">A human woman stands on the edge of a cliff overlooking a vast forest. Taking a deep breath, she focuses on teh sounds and scents carried by the wind. After a minute, she opens her eyes and gracefully jumps off of the cliff's edge, pursuing her quarry.</p>
            <p class="indent">A dwarf nimbly evades teh swing of a monster's mighty claws. Upon landing to the side, the dwarf quickly pivots and immediately leaps toward the terrifying beast. HIs glaive at teh ready, the dwarf focuses all of his energy into his swing, delivering a fatal blow as the beast unleashes its final cry.</p>
            <p class="indent">Hunters and slayers of foul monsters, the mighty yeagers are warriors who studdy the occult and obtain enhanced abilities, senses, and speed with which to better combat the supernatural.</p>
            <h4>Monster Hunters</h4>
            <p>Yaegers are monster hunters, training to refine their bodies, minds, and senses to better fight against foul beasts. They study occultism and the supernatural, and learn the ways of combat to fight against such threats. In addition to their rigorous martial and endurance training, yaegers learn to master their focus and mental composure. Through the use of such focus, they can exercise better control of their resolve and attacks to deliver deadlier blows. When yaegers are on a hunt, they focus almost exclusively on the task at hand.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once they reach a certain point, a yaeger joins a yaeger guild; a group of yaegers who utilize different abilities to supplement their martial prowess and apporach monster hunting in unique ways. When a yaegar joins a yaegar guild, it involves some type of supernaturally infused induction ceremony; a mystical riutal, a foul concoction, or a special rite. This grants a yaeger supernatural abilities that make them more capable of fighting terribel and otherwordly threats, and often alters their appearance or personality.</p>
            <h4>Supernatural Slayers</h4>
            <p>By definition, the life of a yaeger is one of adventuring. Until their dying breath, a yaeger dedicates their life to hunting foul creatures and terrifying beasts. From undead and werewolves to aberrations and fiends, yaegers journey to the darkest of realms and the most haunting of places to fight against the vile creatures that threaten the mortal realms.</p>
            <p class="indent">At their core, yaegers are professional students of the occult and slayers of monsters. This makes them incredibly useful members of an adventuring party, as their skills make them dangerous foes both on and off the battlefield. Since monsters never rest, neither do yaegers, and their work is never done.</p>
            <h5>Yaegers in Yvarra</h5>
            <p>In Yvarra, yaegers are the premier and most efficient monster hunters in the world. However, yaegers as they are known in modern Yvarra were not always the monster hunters that they became to be. The origins of yaegers can be traced back thousands of years ago to the now ruined and accursed land of Satama. There, the ancient vyrassa used blood magic to create a group of highly trained 'super hunters' known as reavers. These reavers became an elite order that directly served the Sataman nobility and judicial systems, tracking down criminals and silencing political foes.</p>
            <p class="indent">When Satama fell alongside Athar and Xelegos during the Age of Calamity, many of the ancient texts and rites surrounding reavers were lost. However, shortly before the rise of the Witch Queens and the Age of Witchcraft, explorers uncovered lost texts detailing the rituals that created reavers. Using what they could translate and uncover, certain groups set about trying to create a new age of reavers in order to combat against the growing threat of monsters and otherworldly entities that began to flood ancient Yvarra. During this time, these new reavers fought against these supernatural forces, and it was not long before academics and arcane scholars began to experiment with the Sataman rituals. Many of these experiments were failures, but the ones that succeeded allowed for the creation of new elite super-hunters to fight monsters. Thus, the yaegers of Yvarra as they are known as now were born.</p>
            <h5>Yaeger Origins</h5>
            <p><strong>Nations.</strong>Yvarran yaegers can be members of any race, and their guilds can exist in many lands across Yvarra. Some of the most famous yaeger guilds, such as the hexers and pyromants, operate in the Icilian Empire, Kravnia, the Northern Realms, and Soldan.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Races.</strong>Yvarran yaegers can be members of any race, though they are most often capran, dwarves, elves, graam, grepkin, humans, isf√∂dda, ursa, and vyrassa.</p>
            <h5>Roles of the Yaeger</h5>
            <p>Yaegers are monster hunters through and through. Very rarely does their role in society at large stray too far from this, though some employ yaegers for various tasks that are best suited for their skills and fighting and tracking.</p>
            <p class="indent">Though many yaegers specialize in fighting particular types of supernatural entities and beings, a yaeger can wield their ritualistically imbued gifts to combat against any form of extraplanar or otherworldly threat. However, some yaegers often end up fighting mortals as well, frequently becoming involved in political affairs, warfare, criminal activity, and the squabbles of nobles. Regardless of their nature of their work, yaegers primarily pursue supernatural threats and dispose of dangerous magical creatures, often charging for their services or expecting favors for their guilds in return.</p>
            <p class="indent">The following roles are optional, flavor-driven choices a player can make that can influence what kind of hunter and tracker an Yvarran yaeger can be. You can choose to roll randomly on the table below, choose an option, or work with your GM to create a role.</p>

            <h4>Elements of Yaeger Characters</h4>
            <p>The life of a yaeger is one filled with violence, long periods of travel, and harsh conditions. Because of this, think about why your character decided to become a yaeger in the first place. Was it something that was expected of them, or was triggered by a dark event?</p>
            <p class="indent">Second, yaegers train with others under the tutelage and instruction of a seasoned yaeger, known as a master. What was your instructor like? Were they careful to teach you all that you need to know, or were they distant and tough on you to learn things by experience?</p>
            <p class="indent">When making your yaeger character more unique, consider utilizing the following sections and their associated tables: Inception, Master, and Memento.</p>
            <h5>Inception</h5>
            <p>Not everyone is cut out to be a yaeger; a yaeger's life is filled with turmoil and uncertainty that can drive those who lack dedication and resolve quite mad.</p>
            <p class="indent">When creating a yaeger, consider what did lead them to take up this life. What was it that motivated them?</p>
            <table class="inception">
			    <thead>
			        <tr><td class="col-5">d6</td><td class="left">Inception</td></tr>

		    </table>
            <h5>Master</h5>
            <p>Yaegers who live to become masters are those with enough experience, wisdom, and resolve to have avoided death at the hands of the supernatural. These masters have grown old in a profession where many die young, sharing their knowledge with new yaegers.</p>
            <p class="indent">Think about the kind of master you trained under. Who were they? What was your relationship to them?</p>
            <table class="master">
			    <thead>
		            <tr><td class="col-5">d6</td><td class="left">Master</td></tr>

		        <tr><td> 3</td><td class="left">You were taught by a being of supernatural origin - a werewolf, a fiend, or even a revenant. They taught you to fight and to see things objectively.</td></tr>

	        </table>
            <h5>Memento</h5>
            <p>Yaegers carry with them something that represents their story, earned in training or something they pried off of the corpse of a monster they killed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider what kind of memento your yaeger carries. What is it, and how did you acquire it?</p>
            <table class="memento">
			    <thead>
		            <tr><td class="col-5">d6</td><td class="left">Memento</td></tr>

            <h4>Creating a Yaeger</h4>
            <p>When creating a yaeger, think about what drove your character to take up this life. Did a tragic event occur in their past, or were their lives changed by a monster?</p>
            <p class="indent">Next, think about how your yaeger perceives and views the occult and supernatural. Do they view all monsters as just that - monsters?</p>
            <p class="indent">Do they believe many creatures labeled as monsters to be misunderstood, having their own personalities and problems that mortals might not understand or even be aware of?</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, consider your character's personal history with the supernatural prior to the start of the campaign. What occult or supernatural entities have they encountered, and in what way? Were they ignorant to many elements of the supernatural prior to becoming a yaeger? Or have they experienced the paranormal first hand, either willingly or by way of some gruesome and horrifying event that left them scarred?</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, discuss with your GM how yaegers are perceived by most people, as well as how common yaegers are in your setting. Are yaegers heralded as saviors? Or are yaegers seen as monsters themselves? Are there famous and established guilds of yaegers, or are yaegers created in secrecy and are no longer as common throughout the world as they once were? Are there any yaeger guilds that are famed for their exploits, having fought off threat after threat? Or are many yaeger guilds dangerous organizations, universally feared for their ritualistic practices and supernatural powers?</p>
            <p class="indent">Talk to your GM about the role played by yaegers in the campaign.</p>
            <h5>Quick Build</h5>
            <p>You can make a yaeger quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution or Wisdom. Second, choose a background found in Chapter 4 of this book.</p>
